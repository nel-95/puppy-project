      	  <p class= "WhatWeDo"> Saving Romanian Strays was set up in 2014 by volunteers to rescue stray dogs from Romania. There are thousands of them on the streets because of the country's political history, as well as the general refusal to neuter and spay dogs. Many die on the streets beaten, poisoned or starved. If they are rounded up by the authorities they end up in brutal public shelters, where many are left to die from injuries or sickness. SRS aims to save as many of these dogs by giving them a chance to find their forever home in the UK. </p>

      	  <h2 class= "WhatYouCanDo"> What You Can Do </h2>
      	  <p class= "WhatYouCanDo"> Dog rescue work is costly: getting food and treatment to the dogs most in need, arranging the health checks and vaccinations before they travel, and especially the transport costs to the UK. We can't do it without people like you and your donations of time and money. We have lots of fundraising schemes to take part in: facebook auctions, a monthly lottery and pledges to help each dog make it to its new forever home in the UK. We also need volunteers to help with transport and homechecks. </p>

	  	  <h2 class= "FosterorAdopt"> Foster or Adopt </h2>
	  	  <p class= "FosterorAdopt"> Out of thousands of dogs, only a few will be plucked to safety by rescue groups like Saving Romanian Strays.  Once we have found a foster home for a dog, or someone to adopt a dog, the wheels are set in motion to raise funds to transport it to the UK. They are neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, checked by a vet and given a passport to travel. Fosterers are given full support from SRS until a permanent home is found. We are always looking for new fosterers to join the dog rescue work and get these dogs out of the shelters, off the streets and ready to be adopted.
